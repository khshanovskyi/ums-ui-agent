# ## What to Include
# 1. Role & Purpose
# 2. Core Capabilities of Agent
# 3. Behavioral Rules - How should it behave?
#    - When to ask for confirmation
#    - What order to try operations
#    - How to handle missing information
#    - How to format responses
# 4. Error Handling - What to do when things fail
# 5. Boundaries - What it should NOT do or when to decline requests
